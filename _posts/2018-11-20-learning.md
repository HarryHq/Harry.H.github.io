Amy Cuddy, social psychologist and Associate Professor at Harvard Business School, uses experimental methods to investigate how people judge and influence each other and themselves.

哈佛商学院的社会心理学家兼副教授艾米·卡迪（Amy Cuddy）用实验的方法调查人们是如何判断和影响彼此和自己的.

Her research suggests that judgments along two critical trait dimensions — warmth/trustworthiness and competence/power — shape social interactions, determining such outcomes as who gets hired and who doesn’t, when we are more or less likely to take risks, why we admire, envy, or disparage certain people, elect politicians, or even target minority groups for genocide.

她的研究表明，判断沿着两个关键特征维度——热情/可信赖和能力/权力——塑造社会互动，决定诸如谁被雇佣，谁不被雇佣这样的结果，当我们或多或少地承担风险的时候，我们为什么钦佩、嫉妒或贬低别人，选举政治家，甚至针对少数族裔群体进行种族灭绝。

Cuddy’s recent work focuses on how we embody and express competence and warmth, linking our body language to our feelings, physiology, and behavior. Her latest research illuminates how “faking” body postures that convey competence and power (“power posing”) — even for as little as two minutes — changes our testosterone and cortisol levels, increases our appetite for risk, causes us to perform better in job interviews, and generally configures our brains to cope well in stressful situations.

Cuddy最近的研究集中在我们如何体现表达能力和温暖，将我们的肢体语言与我们的感觉、生理和行为联系起来。她的最新研究揭示了“假装”身体姿势是如何传递能力和力量的，哪怕只有两分钟，也会改变我们的睾酮和皮质醇水平，增加我们对风险的欲望，使我们在求职面试中表现得更好，而且一般来说。它们还可以调节我们的大脑以应付紧张的情况。

In short, as David Brooks summarized the findings, “If you act powerfully, you will begin to think powerfully.” Ultimately, Cuddy's research suggests that when people feel personally powerful, they become more present: better connected with their own thoughts and feelings, which helps them to better connect with the thoughts and feelings of others. Presence — characterized by enthusiasm, confidence, engagement, and the ability to connect with and even captivate an audience — boosts people's performance in a wide range of domains.

简而言之，正如David Brooks总结的结果，“如果你表现的很强大，那么你的思维也会变得很强大。” 最终，Cuddy的研究表明，当人们觉得自己很有强大时，他们变得更加强大：让自己的思想和感情更好地结合，这有助于他们更好地与他人的思想和感情联系起来。风度——以热情、自信、投入，以及与观众联系甚至是吸引观众的能力为特征——在很多领域提升人们的表现。

Amy Cuddy: People make the mistake of making these big goals, these big sort of New Year's resolutions. And we also know that they often backfire. That, you know, by January 15 a lot of people have given up on their New Year's resolutions. Why is it that we keep making them and keep failing? Because they're so big, they're so distant and they require a million little steps in between. And each of those steps is an opportunity to fail.

Amy Cuddy：人们犯下了设立大目标的错误，这可以说是新年的重大决定。我们也知道这经常适得其反。你知道，到了1月15日，很多人放弃了他们的新年目标。为什么我们不断地设立目标又不断放弃它呢？因为它们太大了，它们太遥远了，它们之间需要一百万个小台阶。每一步都存在失败可能。

And they're very much outcome focused. It's not ab out how I'm going to feel, you know, tomorrow. It's I'm going to lose this much weight. I'm going to get this kind of job. I'm going to become a better public speaker. It's things like that. I'm going to run a marathon. I think a lot of research is showing us that we do much better when we focus on incremental change, on little bits of improvement.

他们非常注重结果。你知道，这不是明天我感觉将会怎么样。而是我将会失去这么多东西。我将得到这样的工作。我要成为一个更好的演说家。事情就是这样。我要参加马拉松比赛。我认为很多研究表明，当我们专注于渐进的变化、改进的点点滴滴时，我们会做得更好。

We're not focused on the outcome. So we're not focused on the grade or did you get the job or not. And you're not focused on the, you know, big New Year's resolution. You're just focused on the process in this next moment that's coming up. And that allows you to grow a little bit over time to not think of each of these steps as an opportunity to fail. And eventually, you know, in aggregate you get there. You may not even realize it until one day you turn around and say wow, this thing is much easier for me now than it was a year ago.

我们没有关注结果。所以我们不关注成绩或者你是否得到了这份工作。你并没有集中精力在新年新年目标上。你只关注下一刻即将到来的过程。这会让你一点一点的成长，不要以为每一步都是失败的可能。最终，你总能到达那里。直到有一天，你转身说，哇，这件事对我来说比一年前容易多了。

I think Carol Dweck's work on growth versus fixed mindsets, to me that's the most important work around this idea of self-nudging. Carol Dweck's idea is that when you have kids focus on school tasks not as opportunities to win or fail but as, you know, challenges that will allow them to stretch and grow, that's a growth mindset. They do much better. You build children who are resilient and strong and actually enjoy school and end up doing well. You build children who thrive.

我认为Carol Dweck对增长与固定心态的研究，对我来说，这是最重要的工作围绕这个自我轻推的想法。Carol Dweck的观点是，当你有孩子不是把学业重点放在赢或失败的机会上，你知道，而是放在挑战上时，这会让他们得到学习和成长，这是一种成长心态。这会让他们做得更好。你培养的孩子是有弹性的和强壮的，而且很享受学校学业，并最终做得很好。你在让孩子茁壮成长。

When kids are focused on each grade as a failure or a win, so they're very outcome focused you're not building resilient kids because people are going to fail, you know. So if they are set back by every one of those failures they don't become resilient. What I'm talking about is really the same kind of thing, you know. You change your body language, you go into that next big challenge and you feel a little bit calmer, a little bit safer. And most importantly you leave not feeling that sense of regret, not feeling like I didn't show them who I am. You leave feeling like I showed them who I am and I can accept whatever the outcome is.

当孩子们把每一个成绩都看成是失败或胜利的时候，他们是非常注重结果的，你不会建立有弹性的孩子，因为他们将会失败，你知道。因此，如果他们被这些失败所恐惧，他们就不会变得有弹性。我所说的其实是同一件事，你懂的。你改变了你的肢体语言，你进入了下一个大挑战，你感觉有点平静，有点安全。最重要的是，你不感到遗憾，不觉得我没有做真实的自己。你让人感觉就像这就是我，我可以接受任何结果。

And that is beautiful. I would say when I look at the thousands of emails that I've gotten over the years since the TED talk. People tell me about some big challenge, you know, job interview, a test they took, confronting someone who they were having trouble with, standing up for themselves at work. And they don't talk about whether or not they won. What they talk about is how the feel when they left.

那是美丽的。我会说，当我看到成千上万的电子邮件，我已经获得了多年以来的TED谈话。人们告诉我一些重大的挑战，你知道，面试，他们采取了测试，面对他们遇到麻烦的人，在工作中振作起来。他们不谈论他们是否赢了。他们谈论的是当他们离开时的感觉

And I don't even know that they know they're doing that. But what they're telling me is I just felt so much better. I felt like myself. I felt that I could be brave. I left feeling good. And sometimes they even forget to tell me what the outcome was which I think is like – I think it's beautiful because I would much rather have a world full of people, you know, feeling that they're being themselves and able to accept an outcome even if it's negative than a world full of people who are trying to win all the time.

我甚至不知道他们自己这么做。但他们告诉我的只是：我感觉好多了。我感觉就像我自己一样。我觉得我可以勇敢。我感觉很好。有时他们甚至忘了告诉我结果如何,我想是这样的，我觉得它很美。因为我宁愿拥有一个充满人的世界，你知道，感觉他们在成为自己并且能够接受结果, 即使它比一个总是想赢全世界的人还消极

The way to kind of a healthy and happy life is not to be focused on winning. It's to be focused on having real meaningful authentic interactions and knowing that you did what you could and that you can't control everything the other person does or what they think of you. The key is that instead of managing the impression that we're making on others, we really need to manage the impression that we're making on ourselves, right. So we need to feel good about ourselves.

一种健康快乐的生活方式不是在于赢。而是专注于真正意义上的真实互动和了解你能做的，你不能控制其他人做的事情，或者他们对你的看法。关键是不要理会我们给别人留下的印象，我们真的需要在意的是我们给自己的感觉，对吧？所以我们需要自我感觉良好。

We need to feel strong. We need to believe in ourselves. And that then leads us to make a much better impression on other people. But if we're trying to choreograph an orchestrate it, you know, move your hand this way when you say this word. Nobody likes that. It comes across as inauthentic and you leave feeling like a phony.

我们需要自我感觉强大。我们需要相信自己。这会让我们给别人留下更好的印象。但是如果我们试图编排一个乐队时，你知道，当你这么说，但你又不这么做时。没人喜欢这个。这是不真实的，你让人觉得你像个骗子，表里不一
