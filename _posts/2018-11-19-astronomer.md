### NASA astronomer Michelle Thaller on ​the multiple dimensions of space and human sexuality

### 美国宇航局天文学家Michelle Thaller关于空间和人类性行为的多重维度解释

<small>Science and the squishiness of the human mind. The joys of wearing whatever the hell you want, and so much more.</small>

<small>科学与人类心灵的懦弱。穿着的乐趣是，无论你穿什么都感觉很开心</small>

* Why can't we have a human-sized cat tree?
* What would happen if you got a spoonful of a neutron star?
* Why do we insist on dividing our wonderfully complex selves into boring little boxes


* 为什么我们不能有一个人体大小的猫架？
* 如果你得到一匙中子星会发生什么？
* 为什么我们坚持把奇妙复杂的自我分割成无聊的小块？

This morning on the way to the school bus, my almost 11 year old son was explaining to me that if you shrunk an elephant down to the size of a mouse, it would shiver, then die, because of its slow mitochondria, due to something called the Rule of Squared Threes, which he also proceeded to explain. Then he explained something about neutron stars, claiming that they are essentially a giant atom, which I don't think is actually true. Then he started on another topic and I explained that this was all very wonderful but that I had learned all the science my brain could hold at 7:15 am.

今天早上，在去校车的路上，我快11岁的儿子向我解释说，如果你把一头大象缩小到老鼠那么大，它就会颤抖，然后因为线粒体缓慢而死，这是因为一种叫做“三平方律”的东西，他也继续解释它。然后他解释了一些关于中子星的事情，声称它们本质上是一个巨大的原子，我并不这样认为。然后他开始谈另一个话题，我说，这一切都非常奇妙，但我在早上7点15分已经学会了我大脑所能掌握的所有科学。

Sadly, my own journey as a scientist ended in high school biology, when I put the dissected tail of a fetal pig on a toothpick and said "Hors d'oeuvres?" to several classmates, which earned me an F for the project.

可悲的是，我把一头经过解剖的胎猪尾巴插上牙签，然后问同学说“这是点心？”，这时我作为一名科学家的旅程在高中生物学上就结束了，为此我这门课的成绩得了F。

But happily, there are people like my guest today, Astronomer Michelle Thaller, and my son Emre, who are excellent at explaining scientific wonders to dummkopfs like myself. Michelle is—let me take a deep breath here—the Assistant Director of Science for Communications at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

但令人高兴的是，今天有像我的客人，天文学家米歇尔·萨勒和我儿子埃姆雷这样的人，他们擅长向像我这样的傻瓜解释科学奇迹。米歇尔是-让我深吸一口气-美国宇航局戈达德航天飞行中心的通信科学助理主任。

 And her inspiring perspective on science and humanity—which she shares in her TV shows and her podcast Orbital Path—makes me wish that biology teacher had had a better sense of humor.

 她在电视节目和播客频道上分享关于科学与人文的感悟，让我希望生物老师有更好的幽默感。
