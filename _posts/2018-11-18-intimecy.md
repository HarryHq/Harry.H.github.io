## Intimacy and sexual desire in couples can be heightened by this practice

* Scientists say coordinating movements leads to increased intimacy and sexual desire in a couple.
* The improved rapport and empathy was also observed in people who didn't know each other.
* Non-verbal clues are very important in the development stages of a relationship.


* 科学家说，协调运动导致夫妻双方亲密度和性欲增加
* 在不认识的人中也观察到了友好关系和共鸣的提高
* 非语言线索在关系发展阶段是非常重要的

If you are walking side by side with someone, chances are your footsteps will eventually become synchronized. The same goes for intimate relationships, says a new research paper. Synchronizing with your significant other can directly affect the intimacy levels of the pair.

如果你和某人并肩行走，很可能你的脚步最终会变得同步。一份新的研究论文说，亲密关系也是如此。与你的另一半同步会直接影响对方的亲密程度。

This capacity to sync up with others is observed from early childhood. For example, the heart rates of mothers and their infants become synchronized during free play, as a study showed. This suggests that the coordination aids social interactions with caregivers by fulfilling the need for safety and connection, as writes one of the paper's authors Gurit E. Birnbaum.

这种能力与其他人同步是从幼儿时期观察到的。例如，一项研究表明，母亲和她们的婴儿在自由玩耍时的心率是同步的。这表明协调通过满足安全和连接的需要来帮助与照顾者的社会互动，正如本文作者之一Gurit E.Birnbaum所写的。

Synchronizing motor activities can create a sense of unity even between people who didn't previously know each other, increasing feelings of being connected, improving cooperation and compassion. The same goes for romantic relationships, with synchronicity being considered a hallmark of strong relationships.

同步运动活动可以创造一种团结的感觉，甚至在之前互不相识的人之间，还可以增加被联系的感觉，甚至改善合作和同理心。浪漫关系也是如此，同步性被认为是牢固关系的标志。

Four recent studies, published under the title "Being on the same wavelength," demonstrate synchrony has an intimacy-promoting function in the beginning and development stages of relationships. That's when the need to connect is especially strong, causing both new and long-term partners to use non-verbal clues that indicate readiness to have contact.

最近发表在“处于同一波长”标题下的四项研究表明，在人际关系的开始和发展阶段，同步具有促进亲密的作用。在那个时候，联系的需求特别强烈，导致新伙伴和长期伙伴都使用非语言暗示，表明准备接触。

The studies, carried out by Israeli scientists, looked at how people interacted while pedaling on stationary bicycles which shared a front wheel. In two situations, the subjects did not know each other previously. One of them was asked to share either a neutral or positive event (like a promotion at work), while the other listened. The researchers measured synchrony by looking at the speeds with which the participants pedaled and their rating of the other's responsiveness or empathy. They found that pedaling in sync increased the reported rapport and a sense of connectedness between the subjects.

这些由以色列科学家进行的研究观察了人们在踩着共用前轮的固定自行车时如何进行互动。在两种情况下，受试者之前并不认识对方。其中一人被要求分享一个中立或积极的事件（比如在工作中的晋升），而另一个则倾听。研究人员通过观察参与者的脚步速度和他们对对方的反应或同理心的评价来测量同步性。他们发现在同步中蹬腿增加了报道的融洽感和受试者之间的亲密感。

In the other two experiments, people in the couple were romantically involved. One study had the participants listening to the sound of coordinated or uncoordinated footsteps, while being asked to imagine themselves walking next to their partner. After that, the subjects rated their level of intimacy.

在另外两个实验中，夫妻中的人浪漫地参与其中。一是让参与者听协调或不协调的脚步声，同时让他们想象自己走在伴侣旁边。实验结束之后，让受试者自己评价他们的亲密程度。

The study showed that imagining being sync with the partner directly related to how intimate the person felt they were with their partner. The reason for this, Birnbaum writes, is that "synchrony can signify unity between partners, thereby generating an atmosphere ripe for reciprocal exchanges of intimacy that may further intensify the emotional bond between them."

研究显示，想象与伴侣的同步直接关系到这个人感觉自己与伴侣有多亲密。Birnbaum写道，这样做的原因是“同步意味着伴侣之间的团结，从而产生一种可以相互间亲密交流的时机，从而进一步加强他们之间的情感纽带。”

In the last experiment, participants were asked to breathe either in or out of sync with their partner. Afterwards, they were asked to rate their perceived intimacy and describe a sexual fantasy. Results showed that partners felt closer and had more sexual desire for each other while breathing in-sync.

在最后一个实验中，参与者被要求与他们的伴侣进行同步或不同步呼吸。之后，他们被要求评价他们的亲密感并描述性幻想。结果表明，在同步呼吸时，合作伙伴感觉更亲密，有更多的性欲。

One big takeaway from the research that couples can build on is that "non-verbal displays of synchrony during ordinary activities in everyday lives can deepen the experience of closeness and sexual desire between partners," state the researchers.

研究人员说，从研究中得到的一大收获是，“建立夫妻日常生活中日常活动中非言语的同步表达，可以加深夫妻之间亲密和性欲的体验。”
